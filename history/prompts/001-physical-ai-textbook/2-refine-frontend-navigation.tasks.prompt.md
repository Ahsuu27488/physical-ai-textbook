  **Task:** Refine Frontend Navigation (Milestone 2 Polish).

  **The Issue:**
  The current Docusaurus sidebar is generating "Index Pages" (lists of cards) for Modules and Weeks. This creates redundancy where the "Module Intro" appears as just another card, and the sidebar shows duplicate hierarchy levels.

  **The Solution:**
  Configure all content folders (Modules and Weeks) to link directly to their main document.

  **Execution Steps:**
  1.  Iterate through `frontend/docs/` folders (Module 1-4, Weeks 1-7).
  2.  In each folder, create (or update) a `_category_.json` file.
  3.  Set the configuration to:
      ```json
      {
        "label": "Current Folder Name",
        "position": X,
        "link": {
          "type": "doc",
          "id": "intro"
        }
      }
      ```
      *(Note: Ensure the main markdown file in each folder is named `intro.md` or `index.md` so the `id` matches. If currently named `module-1.md`, rename it to `intro.md` for consistency).*

  4.  **Verify:** The goal is that clicking a sidebar parent (e.g., "Module 1") immediately renders the text content of that module, NOT a list of cards.

  **Context:**
  - Do not change the actual text content inside the markdown files.
  - Keep the `sidebars.js` set to `autogenerated` (this fix works within the autogenerated logic).

  Successfully refined the frontend navigation by updating all `_category_.json` files in the module and week folders. Changed the link type from "generated-index" to "doc" with id "intro" for:

  - frontend/docs/module-1/_category_.json
  - frontend/docs/module-2/_category_.json
  - frontend/docs/module-3/_category_.json
  - frontend/docs/module-4/_category_.json
  - frontend/docs/week-01-02/_category_.json
  - frontend/docs/week-03-05/_category_.json
  - frontend/docs/week-06-07/_category_.json
  - frontend/docs/week-08-10/_category_.json
  - frontend/docs/week-11-12/_category_.json
  - frontend/docs/week-13/_category_.json

  All folders already had intro.md files, so the "id": "intro" configuration works correctly. This change ensures that clicking on a sidebar parent (e.g., "Module 1") will immediately render the content of that module's intro document instead of showing a generated index page with cards.
outcome: Frontend navigation refined successfully - sidebar now links directly to module/week intro documents instead of generating index pages with cards, eliminating redundancy and improving user experience.

# Implementation: Refine Frontend Navigation

## Summary

Successfully refined the frontend navigation by updating all `_category_.json` files in the module and week folders to link directly to their intro documents instead of generating index pages with cards.

## Changes Made

Updated 10 `_category_.json` files to change the link type from "generated-index" to "doc" with id "intro":

- `frontend/docs/module-1/_category_.json`
- `frontend/docs/module-2/_category_.json`
- `frontend/docs/module-3/_category_.json`
- `frontend/docs/module-4/_category_.json`
- `frontend/docs/week-01-02/_category_.json`
- `frontend/docs/week-03-05/_category_.json`
- `frontend/docs/week-06-07/_category_.json`
- `frontend/docs/week-08-10/_category_.json`
- `frontend/docs/week-11-12/_category_.json`
- `frontend/docs/week-13/_category_.json`

## Technical Details

Each `_category_.json` file was updated from:
```json
{
  "label": "Module/Week Name",
  "position": X,
  "link": {
    "type": "generated-index",
    "description": "..."
  }
}
```

To:
```json
{
  "label": "Module/Week Name",
  "position": X,
  "link": {
    "type": "doc",
    "id": "intro"
  }
}
```

## Result

The sidebar now links directly to the intro document of each module/week instead of showing a generated index page with cards. This eliminates redundancy where the "Module Intro" appeared as just another card and removes duplicate hierarchy levels in the sidebar.

## Validation

- All target folders already contained `intro.md` files, so the `"id": "intro"` configuration works correctly
- The `sidebars.js` remains set to `autogenerated` as requested
- No changes were made to the actual text content inside markdown files
