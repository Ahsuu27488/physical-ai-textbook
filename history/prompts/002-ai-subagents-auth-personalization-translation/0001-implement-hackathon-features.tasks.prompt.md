## Prompt

/sp.phr

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification, plan, research, data model, API contracts, and tasks for implementing Claude Code Subagents, BetterAuth integration, content personalization, and Urdu translation features for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook platform.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Completed full specification and planning for hackathon features worth 150 bonus points
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created spec, plan, research, data model, contracts, and tasks documents
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement to start implementation of the features
- 🧠 Reflection: Structured approach with proper documentation before implementation ensures quality and traceability

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): none needed
