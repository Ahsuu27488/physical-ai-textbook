# Weeks 11-12: Humanoid Robot Development

## Learning Objectives

During these two weeks, students will focus specifically on the challenges and techniques unique to humanoid robot development, including kinematics, dynamics, locomotion, and human-robot interaction.

## Topics Covered

- **Humanoid robot kinematics and dynamics**
  - Forward and inverse kinematics for humanoid robots
  - Dynamic modeling and control
  - Center of mass management

- **Bipedal locomotion and balance control**
  - Walking gaits and stability
  - Balance control algorithms
  - Terrain adaptation

- **Manipulation and grasping with humanoid hands**
  - Hand kinematics and dexterity
  - Grasp planning and execution
  - Object manipulation strategies

- **Natural human-robot interaction design**
  - Social robotics principles
  - Gesture and expression
  - Safety considerations for human environments

## Key Concepts

### Humanoid Robot Kinematics

Humanoid robots present unique kinematic challenges:

- **Redundant manipulators**: Multiple solutions for reaching a target
- **Whole-body coordination**: Coordinating arms, legs, and torso
- **Kinematic constraints**: Joint limits and collision avoidance
- **Task prioritization**: Managing multiple simultaneous objectives

### Bipedal Locomotion

Walking on two legs requires sophisticated control:

- **Zero Moment Point (ZMP)**: Maintaining balance during walking
- **Capture Point**: Predicting where to step to maintain balance
- **Walking patterns**: Creating stable gait patterns
- **Disturbance rejection**: Handling external forces and perturbations

### Balance Control

Humanoid robots must maintain balance in various conditions:

- **Feedback control**: Using sensor data to maintain balance
- **Feedforward control**: Anticipating balance requirements
- **Reactive stepping**: Taking emergency steps when balance is lost
- **Ankle, hip, and stepping strategies**: Different balance recovery methods

### Human-Robot Interaction

Humanoid robots must interact safely and naturally with humans:

- **Social conventions**: Understanding human social behaviors
- **Safety protocols**: Ensuring safe operation around humans
- **Communication**: Non-verbal communication through movement and expression
- **Trust building**: Creating robots that humans feel comfortable with
