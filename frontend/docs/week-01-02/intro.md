# Weeks 1-2: Introduction to Physical AI

## Learning Objectives

During these first two weeks, students will establish a foundational understanding of Physical AI concepts and the broader field of embodied intelligence.

## Topics Covered

- **Foundations of Physical AI and embodied intelligence**
  - Understanding the difference between digital AI and physical AI
  - The importance of embodiment in AI systems
  - How physical interaction shapes intelligence

- **From digital AI to robots that understand physical laws**
  - The transition from simulation to reality
  - Physical constraints and considerations
  - Real-world sensor and actuator limitations

- **Overview of humanoid robotics landscape**
  - Current state of humanoid robotics
  - Key players and technologies
  - Future directions and applications

- **Sensor systems: LIDAR, cameras, IMUs, force/torque sensors**
  - Types of sensors used in robotics
  - Sensor fusion concepts
  - Data acquisition and processing

## Key Concepts

### Physical AI vs. Digital AI

Physical AI represents a fundamental shift from AI systems that operate purely in digital spaces to systems that function in and interact with the physical world. This introduces new challenges:

- **Real-time constraints**: Physical systems have timing requirements
- **Uncertainty**: Real-world sensing is noisy and incomplete
- **Safety**: Physical systems can cause damage if not properly controlled
- **Embodiment**: The physical form affects the AI's capabilities and constraints

### Embodied Intelligence

Embodied intelligence is the theory that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment. Key principles include:

- The body shapes cognition
- Intelligence is distributed between brain, body, and environment
- Physical interaction is essential for certain types of learning

## Assignments

1. Research paper review: "The Importance of Embodied Intelligence"
